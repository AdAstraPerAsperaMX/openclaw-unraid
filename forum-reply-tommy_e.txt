Hey Tommy_E! Great catch on the config overwrite issue — you were spot on.

I've pushed your fix to the template. The PostArgs now checks if the config exists before writing:

[ -f /root/.openclaw/openclaw.json ] || echo '{...}' > /root/.openclaw/openclaw.json

So configs will persist across container restarts now. Really appreciate you digging into this and suggesting the fix!
