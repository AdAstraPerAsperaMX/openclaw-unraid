Hey MrChunky! Thanks for the detailed logs — that helped pinpoint the issue.

The "No API key found for anthropic" error happens because OpenClaw defaults to Claude models. When you're using a different provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter), you need to change the default model to match your API key.

Why this happens: OpenClaw is designed to run an onboarding wizard (openclaw onboard) that walks you through setup, including model selection. But with a Community Apps deployment, you're getting a ready-to-go container — no CLI wizard. So the default model stays set to Anthropic even if you provide a different provider's key.

Quick fix:
1. Open the Control UI (http://YOUR-IP:18789/?token=YOUR_TOKEN)
2. Go to Config tab
3. Click Raw JSON (the UI editor doesn't expose this setting yet)
4. Add the agents section with your preferred model:

{
  "gateway": {
    "mode": "local",
    "bind": "lan",
    "controlUi": { "allowInsecureAuth": true },
    "auth": { "mode": "token" }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": { "primary": "YOUR_PROVIDER/MODEL_NAME" }
    }
  }
}

Common model values:
- Anthropic: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
- Google Gemini: google/gemini-2.0-flash
- OpenAI: openai/gpt-4o
- Groq: groq/llama-3.1-70b-versatile
- OpenRouter: openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-sonnet

5. Save and restart the container

I've updated the GitHub README with a full guide:

Also pushed a fix for the config overwrite issue — your config should now persist across restarts.

Thanks for testing!
