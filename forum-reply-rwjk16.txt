Good question! OpenClaw does have built-in Tailscale Serve/Funnel support, but it requires the tailscale CLI to be available to the OpenClaw process. In Docker, that's not the case — the container doesn't have Tailscale installed.

The issue you're hitting is that nodes require a secure connection (WSS/HTTPS), which plain HTTP over the Tailscale IP doesn't provide.

I haven't personally tested this, but in theory you could run Tailscale Serve on the Unraid host (outside the container) to proxy HTTPS to the container's port. Something like:

tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 http://localhost:18789

Then access via: https://<your-machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443/

That said, I'm not an expert on Tailscale Serve with secure WebSocket connections, so use at your own discretion. I'd recommend checking the Tailscale and OpenClaw docs before running commands on your host:

Tailscale Serve docs: https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve
OpenClaw Tailscale docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/tailscale

If you get it working, let us know! Would be great info for others hitting the same issue.
