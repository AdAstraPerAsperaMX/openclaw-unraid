Good news — OpenClaw does support Kimi! The bad news is it's not as simple as the other providers.

Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, and OpenRouter work with just an API key because OpenClaw has them built-in. Kimi (Moonshot) requires a custom models.providers block in the config due to how the OpenClaw team implemented provider support.

Adding this to the template would break it for users of the other LLMs, so I'm keeping the template focused on the built-in providers for now.

If you want to use Kimi, you'll need to manually edit your config via Raw JSON in the Control UI:

{
  "gateway": {
    "mode": "local",
    "bind": "lan",
    "controlUi": { "allowInsecureAuth": true },
    "auth": { "mode": "token" }
  },
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "moonshot": {
        "baseUrl": "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
        "apiKey": "YOUR_MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
        "models": [{ "id": "kimi-k2.5", "name": "Kimi K2.5" }]
      }
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": { "primary": "moonshot/kimi-k2.5" }
    }
  }
}

Available Kimi models:
- moonshot/kimi-k2.5
- moonshot/kimi-k2-thinking
- moonshot/kimi-k2-turbo-preview

As for the config page disappearing — that sounds like a UI bug. Try refreshing, or use Raw JSON mode which tends to be more stable.
